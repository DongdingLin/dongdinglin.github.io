  "bio": "<p>I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the <a href='https://polyunlp.github.io/' target='_blank'>NLP Group</a> at <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/' target='_blank'>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/' target='_blank'>Maggie Wenjie Li</a>. My research focuses on Situated Conversational Recommendation, LLM-based Reasoning, and Multimodal LLMs. Additionally, I am deeply interested in areas such as Speech Generation and Visual Understanding. I am passionate about applying NLP technologies to real-world scenarios, aiming to help people experience the various ways in which AI can enrich their lives.</p><p>Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree from <a href='https://www.sysu.edu.cn/' target='_blank'>Sun Yat-sen University</a>, graduating with a GPA of 3.8/4.0, ranking 37th out of 433 students. I was directly admitted to the Master's program through the postgraduate recommendation and successfully completed my Master's degree, achieving a GPA of 3.9/4.0. During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to be co-advised by <a href='https://minyang.me/' target='_blank'>Prof. Min Yang</a> at SIAT, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p><strong style='color: #e74c3c; font-size: 1.1em; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;'>üîç I am available for the 2025-2026 job market and actively seeking industry research positions in NLP/AI!</strong></p>",
